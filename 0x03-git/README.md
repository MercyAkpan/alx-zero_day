## QUESTION:
For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. 

It’s time to code!

Create these directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js

Create these empty files:

c/c_is_fun.c

js/main.js

js/index.js

Create a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX"

Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"

Add all these new files to git

Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the 

remote server

   ## QUESTION:
    Collaboration: be up to date
Of course, you can also work on the same branch as your co-workers and it’s best if 

you keep up to date with their changes.

For this task – and only for this task – please update your file README.md in the 

main branch from GitHub.com. It’s the only time you are allowed to update and commit 

from GitHub interface.

After you have done that, in your terminal:

Get all changes of the main branch locally (i.e. your README.md file will be updated)

Create a new file up_to_date at the root of your directory and in it, write the git 

command line used

Add up_to_date to git, commit (message: “How to be up to date in git”), and push to 

the origin

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-zero_day

Directory: 0x03-git

File: README.md, up_to_date
